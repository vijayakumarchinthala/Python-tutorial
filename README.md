       We have selected python tutorial as our "PYTHON  PROJECT".Here we have use "FUNCTIONS" module where we defined all neccesary functions in .py file named as "FUNCTIONS" mentioned above.With the help of functions,looping staments (for loop,while loop) and conditional statements(if,elif,else) and especially  we have used expceptional handling  and we have used some statement and etc.Here we have used nearly 550 lines to run our project successfully.
   
       Our "PYTHON TUTORIAL" explains  about "String" and its operators,"Looping statements","Functions","Data types" in data structures,"Linear list"  and its operators,"Stacks and  Queues","Filehandling", and "Exception handiling and "Generators".
